Executive Summary

With support of 2 billion Qubic per month, I will reduce my employment hours and dedicate focused time to full-time content production, resulting in:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ 50 educational YouTube videos
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ 60+ X (Twitter) posts
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ 1 flagship documentary-style video investigating the theory that Qubic creator Sergey Ivancheglo (CFB) is Satoshi Nakamoto and what that means for Qubic
This initiative is strategically timed to amplify Qubic's presence during a potential breakout moment in the broader crypto market.

About Me
I am the content creator behind ‚ÄúThe Great Crypto Escape,‚Äù a YouTube and X (Twitter) presence focused on blockchain technology, now fully dedicated to Qubic.
Current Reach:
‚Ä¢	üì∫ 8,000+ YouTube subscribers
‚Ä¢	üê¶ 4,000+ X (Twitter) followers
I‚Äôve invested thousands of hours into understanding Qubic‚Äôs technical foundations, making my content both accessible and deeply informed. My mission is to be the go-to resource for trustworthy Qubic education and insight.
________________________________________The Problem
Qubic currently lacks sufficient presence on platforms like YouTube and Google, which limits discoverability for newcomers. High-quality educational content is in demand but underproduced.
Each video takes ~5 hours to produce, and while the content consistently garners views ($30/month) is not enough to sustain consistent output alongside a full-time job and family life (I recently became a father).
Community demand is high, but capacity is limited without support.
This proposal bridges that gap.
