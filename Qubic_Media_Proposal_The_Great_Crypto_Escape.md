**About Me**

I am the content creator behind ‚ÄúThe Great Crypto Escape,‚Äù a YouTube and X (Twitter) presence focused on blockchain technology, now fully dedicated to Qubic.
Current Reach:

‚Ä¢	üì∫ 8,000+ YouTube subscribers

‚Ä¢	üê¶ 4,000+ X (Twitter) followers

I‚Äôve invested thousands of hours into understanding Qubic‚Äôs technical foundations, making my content both accessible and deeply informed. My mission is to be the go-to resource for trustworthy Qubic education and insight.


________________________________________
**The Problem**

Qubic currently lacks sufficient presence on platforms like YouTube and Google, which limits discoverability for newcomers. High-quality educational content is in demand but underproduced.

Each video takes ~5 hours to produce, and while the content consistently garners views ($30/month) is not enough to sustain consistent output alongside a full-time job and family life (I recently became a father).

Community demand is high, but capacity is limited without support. This proposal bridges that gap.
